		<p> I am a self-driven problem solver trying to gain experience in and outside the field of Computer Science.
		With this experience, I hope to incorporate technological advancements in improving the lives of the people around us.
		I find meaning in the work I do when it positively impacts different communities.</p>
		
		<p> My past experience as a Digital Technology Intern at Ahmed Amin Group and Teaching Assistant has helped me develop a strong work ethic and familiarity to the workplace setting. 
		In addition, I strive to be a responsible leader and communicator while working with international NGOs like Engineers Without Borders and University Councils such as the CSE Student Leadership Council. 
		I always pay attention to details and prioritize quality and efficiency in my work.
		With my experience and strong background in technologies such as Python, JAVA, C++, and Office, I hope to be a valuable asset for companies.
